# oldskuul
An oldschool, Amiga-style multipart graphics demo written in PowerShell!

Not finished, but close to!

oldskuul is public domain, you can do whatever you want with the code!

There are two cmd-files you can use to start the demo:

RunMe_PS5.cmd (run in PowerShell 5, included with Windows)
RunMe_PS7.cmd (run in PowerShell 7, need to be installed separately)
